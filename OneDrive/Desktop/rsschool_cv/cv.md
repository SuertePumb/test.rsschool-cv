3. **About me**: My name is Nikolai. I am 25 years old, currently working as a builder. I want to try myself in programming, since I was fond of computers from a young age and am still looking for a business from which I will enjoy and benefit other people. When I have an interest in a "project" (a task and/or the creation of something) I do this with passion and with the absorption of a large amount of information, regardless of work or study.
